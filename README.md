# Object Detection with YOLO 🚀

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eagleshot/IntroductionToYOLO/blob/main/yolo.ipynb)

Hello! This is a tutorial, where you can learn object detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once). YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. 
It combines object classification and localization in a single neural network, making it incredibly fast and efficient.
You can run this tutorial on Google Colaboratory using a free GPU instance with the button above or on your local machine.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

* Introduction to object detection with YOLO.
* Using pre-trained models for object detection.
* Training a custom model on your own dataset.
* Outlook: Deploy your model on different hardware.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding of YOLO and be able to apply it to various object detection tasks.
